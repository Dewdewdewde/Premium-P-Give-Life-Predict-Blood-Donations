# Premium-Projects
This repo is for datascience projects.
In this Project, i worked with data collected from the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. The center passes its blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. The dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of a random sample of 748 donors. My task be to predict if a blood donor will donate within a given time window. I looked at the full model-building process: from inspecting the dataset to using the tpot library to automate your Machine Learning pipeline.
